# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday April 25th 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started off on the DataQuest machine learning module, first of which is learning about k-means clustering.

**Thoughts** Good progress, the near instant feedback from trying out code and seeing results is a big positive I suspect.

### Day 2: Friday April 26th 2019

**Today's Progress**: More progress on k-means clustering, having now moved on to using scikit-learn to perform the regressions as opposed to trying to hand code the models. Spent most of today ploughing through the cross validation algorithms. Nifty! 
**Thoughts** Good progress, motivation levels remain high!
